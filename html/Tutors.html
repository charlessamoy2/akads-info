			<h1>Who are our Tutors?</h1>
			
			<section id="tutor1" class="left-align">
				<h2>Angela Mercado</h2>
				<p>Angela is a 4th year BS Information Technology Entrepreneurship student from
				the Ateneo de Manila University. She specializes in English and Science.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>"It was hard for me to find possible students to tutor before AKADS. I would tutor the children of my relatives or parents' friends, but these would only be a handful at most. I have so much free time as a colege student, but because I didn't have a lot of connections, I wasn't able to properly maximize my time. AKADS gave me a better platform for both sharing my knowledge to others and maximizing my free time."</p>
				</blockquote>
			</section>

			<section id="tutor2">
				<h2>Jack Palou</h2>
				<p>Jack is a fresh graduate from the Ateneo de Manila University and is seeking to earn some extra cash while he is in Graduate School. He was a consistent honor student in high school and dean's lister in college. Jack can teach Math subjects like Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus. He is also very proficient in Computer Science. </p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>"I never thought that I'd be so into becoming a tutor. I knew teaching was something that I wanted to do for a bit, but I just didn't know how to get into the industry. AKADS, thankfully, showed me how to not only find clients, but also how to tutor properly. Since I started, I have grown a connection with many of my students. I'm loving this experience."</p>
				</blockquote>
			</section>

			<section id="tutor3" class="left-align">
				<h2>Charles Samoy</h2>
				<p>Charles graduated from the University of the Philippines with a degree in Industrial Engineering. He was one of the few Summa Cum Laudes of his batch. Despite every company wanting to recruit Charles right out of college, he decided to take a gap year before fully committing to a job. What he cannot give up, however, is his love for teaching, so he decides to become a Tutor under AKADS during his gap year. Charles is now one of our Math and Science tutors.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>"I just wanted to find more opportunities to teach kids. I've always loved teaching, but I don't want to fully commit to the job during this gap year. AKADS gave me an avenue to find children to teach."</p>
