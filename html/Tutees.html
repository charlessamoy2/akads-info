				<h2>Nate</h2>
				<p>Nate is a Grade 9 Junior High School student from a famous institution. For the longest time, he has struggled in Biology class because of the many terms he needs to learn. Luckily for him, his mom, Melissa found a tutor for him on AKADS! His tutor, Angela, would go to his house every Tuesday and Thursday to help him with Biology. Just last term, he finally became a 2nd honor student! With his tutor's guidance and mother's care, Nate is en route to a becoming a year end awardee. </p>

				<h2>Aliyah</h2>
				<p>Aliyah is a Grade 5 student in Angat, Bulacan. Being in the province, tutors are far and few inbetween, but she needs one to help her with the one subject that is holding her back from her studies. Lucky for her, her mom was able to find AKADs and find her her current tutor, Charles. Charles goes to her home every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday after school to help with her Math homework and exercises. After a few months of tutoring, Aliyah finally graduated first honors. </p>
